     <p>Success isn’t achieved overnight. Behind every great achievement is a trail of small efforts done consistently over time. While talent, opportunity, and motivation are helpful,consistency is what keeps progress alive when those other things fade.
     
     <br>

Many people start with energy and excitement but stop when they face obstacles or lose interest. That’s where consistency becomes powerful, it pushes you forward even when you don’t feel like it.

<br>

Below are key ways consistency leads to success:</p>

<ul>
<li>1. Builds Habits</li>

<li>3. Creates Trust and Reliability</li> Whether in school, business, or relationships, being consistent shows people they can count on you.

<li>4. Strengthens Discipline</li> Sticking to a goal teaches selfcontrol and helps you avoid distractions.
<li>5. Helps overcome failure</li>
 when you stay consistent, failure becomes a step not the end
